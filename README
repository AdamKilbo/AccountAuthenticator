Note to viewers:
	- Currently incomplete.
	- Do not use this program and expect it to be secure. The cryptographic keys are built into the program, and additionally the
		function for decrypting the passwords is easily reversible from the encrypter functions. 

Function of Program
	- This is a program that will register users and allow users to log on, such as you will see on most user based websites.
	- Currently all that is planned with this program is to make a system that will register users and allow registered users to "log
		on". When I have the basic functionality accomplished, I will attempt to do so with security in mind.

Goal
	- I am making this program to explore computer security in user authentication
	- Additionally I am practice object oriented programming, since in previous programs I tended to have long and winding functions. 		This is an attempt to have short functions to accomplish each goal as well as following good style guidelines.
	
Reflections
	- Learned that computer security is a very difficult subject. Teams of people that are smarter than me and do this for a living 
		still fail frequently. This program's goal then is to explore how to encrypt/decrypt codes and authenticate users, not
		necessarily securely since doing so would be an impossible task for someone of my ability.
